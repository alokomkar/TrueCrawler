# TrueCrawler

True crawler is a custom html content crawler created as a part of an assignment. Here are some details on the project :
1. Programming Language : Kotlin
2. Architecture Pattern : MVVM
3. Libraries used : Life cycle components, LiveData, Jsoup

The url to be parsed is currently hard coded and can be easily changed. The solution can be extended with minimal changes.

In order to accomodate multiple parallel tasks, AsyncTasks have been used as they are relatively easy to understand.
